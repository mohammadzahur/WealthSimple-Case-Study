# WealthSimple Case Study
## Overview and Origin

WealthSimple is a Canadian financial technology company that provides investment management and financial planning services. The company was founded in September 2014 by Michael Katchen and Brett Huneycutt with the aim of making investing more accessible and affordable for everyone. The idea for WealthSimple was born out of Katchen's frustration with the lack of transparency and high fees associated with traditional investment management services. He wanted to create a platform that would make investing more transparent, accessible, and affordable for everyone, regardless of their financial knowledge or experience. Since its launch, WealthSimple has grown rapidly, expanding its offerings to include a range of investment products, including robo-advisory services, socially responsible investing portfolios, and cryptocurrency trading. The company has also expanded beyond Canada to the United States and the United Kingdom. WealthSimple has raised a significant amount of funding since its founding in 2014. The company has received funding from a variety of sources, including venture capital firms, strategic investors, and high-net-worth individuals. Here is an overview of some of the funding rounds that WealthSimple has completed:
* Seed funding: In 2014, WealthSimple raised CAD $1.9 million in seed funding from a group of investors that included Power Financial Corporation, a leading Canadian financial services company.

In 2021, WealthSimple announced that it had been acquired by Purpose Financial, a Canadian financial services company, as part of a larger plan to create a leading North American financial technology company. Despite the acquisition, WealthSimple continues to operate independently and maintain its focus on making investing more accessible and affordable for everyone.
